# Hyperparameter-Tuning-with-Keras-Tuner-A-Practical-Guide


In the two notebooks of this repository, we will explore the Keras Tuner library, a powerful tool designed to streamline the hyperparameter tuning process for your TensorFlow models. Hyperparameters are critical variables that influence both the model's architecture and its training process. Selecting the right hyperparameters can significantly enhance model performance and ensure efficient training.

Hyperparameters can be broadly classified into two categories:

- Model Hyperparameters: These parameters define the architecture of the model, such as the number of hidden layers, the number of units within each layer, and the activation functions used.
- Algorithm Hyperparameters: These parameters influence the efficiency and efficacy of the training algorithm, such as the learning rate for optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

To effectively tune these hyperparameters, we will define a hypermodel, which includes both the model architecture and the hyperparameter search space. This can be achieved through two main approaches:

- Model Builder Function: A function that directly constructs the model and incorporates hyperparameters.
- Subclassing the HyperModel Class: This method offers greater flexibility and organization, especially when working with complex models.


### Hypermodel
For this tutorial, we will **subclass the HyperModel class** from the Keras Tuner API to create a customized classification model, allowing us to define specific hyperparameters and their search spaces. Within this subclass, we will implement the build and fit methods to specify the hyperparameters we wish to tune, including learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs.


### Tuner
After defining our hypermodel, we will instantiate a tuner to perform the hyperparameter search. **Keras Tuner offers several tuning strategies, including RandomSearch, Hyperband, Bayesian Optimization, and Sklearn-based tuners**. In this tutorial and the next one, we will focus on two popular methods: **RandomSearch and Hyperband**.

- RandomSearch: This tuner explores a random selection of hyperparameter combinations within the defined search space. It is simple and efficient for relatively smaller search spaces, but as the number of hyperparameters increases, the randomness may miss potentially better combinations.

- Hyperband: This is a more advanced strategy, designed to accelerate hyperparameter optimization by focusing computational resources on the most promising configurations. It initially tests many hyperparameter combinations with fewer epochs and gradually allocates more resources to those performing better. This strategy allows Hyperband to balance exploration and exploitation, making it faster and more efficient for large hyperparameter spaces compared to RandomSearch.

##### When to Use Hyperband vs. Random Search:
- Use Hyperband when you have limited time or computational resources and a large hyperparameter search space. Hyperband excels in quickly identifying promising configurations by pruning less optimal ones.

- Use Random Search if you want to explore the entire search space equally or have enough resources to evaluate all configurations for a full training cycle.


To get started with hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, ensure you have the library installed by running the following command: 

        pip install keras-tuner --upgrade
